# Xlib2 Binding

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/vbsw/xlib?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/vbsw/xlib)

## About
Xlib2 is a binding of Xlib (version 11, release 7) for the programming language Go. This project has been forked from the incomplete Xlib binding for Go due to a complete
void of functionality needed to develop a window manager project I am also working on.

The original Xlib Binding is published at <https://github.com/vbsw/xlib>.
